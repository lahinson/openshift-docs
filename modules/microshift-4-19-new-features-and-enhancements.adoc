[id="microshift-4-19-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
= New features and enhancements

[role="_abstract"]
This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="microshift-4-19-rhel-image-mode_{context}"]
== {op-system-base} image mode (Generally Available)

Installing {microshift-short} by using a bootc container image is now generally available. Previously available as a Technology Preview feature, {op-system-image} is a deployment method that uses a container-native approach to build, deploy, and manage the operating system as a `rhel-bootc` container image. See xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-about-rhel-image-mode.adoc#microshift-about-rhel-image-mode[Understanding image mode for RHEL with {microshift-short}] for more information.

[id="microshift-4-19-ingress-controller-two-config_{context}"]
== Control ingress for your use case with additional parameters

With this release, the `ingress.certificate.Secret`,`ingress.clientTLS`, `ingress.routeAdmissionPolicy`, and `ingress.tlsSecurityProfile` parameters are added to the YAML configuration file for {microshift-short}. These parameters specify security settings for the ingress controller. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-ingress-controller.adoc#microshift-ingress-controller[Using ingress control for a {microshift-short} node].

[id="microshift-4-19-tls-config_{context}"]
== {microshift-short} control plane enhanced with TLS

With this release, configurable transport layer security (TLS) protocols on internal control plane components are enabled to help prevent known insecure protocols, ciphers, or algorithms from accessing the applications you run on {microshift-short}. You use either the TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 with {microshift-short}. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_auth_security/microshift-tls-config.adoc#microshift-tls-config[Configuring TLS security profiles].

[id="microshift-4-19-greenboot-updated_{context}"]
== Check application health with the {microshift-short} healthcheck command

With this release, you can use the `microshift healthcheck` command with various options to run a basic health check on your applications. For more information, see xref:../microshift_running_apps/microshift-greenboot-workload-health-checks.adoc#microshift-greenboot-workload-health-checks[Greenboot workload health checks].

[id="microshift-4-19-observability-metrics_{context}"]
== Collecting metrics using the {microshift-short} Observability service

With this release, you can configure the {microshift-short} Observability service to collect performance and usage metrics for monitoring resources. The following predefined configurations differ in the amount of data collected:

* Small
* Medium
* Large (default)

For more information, see xref:../microshift_running_apps/microshift-observability-service.adoc#microshift-observability-service[Using {microshift-short}] Observability.

[id="microshift-4-19-telemetry_{context}"]
== Telemetry now available
With this release, {microshift-short} adds the Telemeter API. Lightweight attributes can be sent from a connected node to Red{nbsp}Hat to monitor the health of the node. To opt-out of Telemetry, see xref:../microshift_support/microshift-remote-node-monitoring.adoc#microshift-remote-node-monitoring[Remote health monitoring with a connected node].
