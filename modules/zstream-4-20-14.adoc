== Fixed issues

The following issues are fixed for this release:

* Before this update, Operator deployment templates with `hostUsers: false` values were not selected by Cluster Version Operator (CVO), and caused deployments to block user access configuration. As a consequence, deployments without `hostUsers: false` affected user access. With this release, the `hostUsers` issue in Operator deployment templates is fixed, and ensures that they are selected by CVO. As a result, Operator deployment templates with `hostUsers: false` are correctly applied, ensuring consistent user access configurations. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-64828[OCPBUGS-64828])

* Before this update, an invalid `installConfig Override` message caused a registration failure, leading to skipped re-registration in the `assisted-service` component. As a consequence, the installation failed. With this release, the issue with the invalid `installConfig Override` messages is fixed. As a result, `assisted-service` installations do not fail due to invalid `installConfig Override` messages. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-65901[OCPBUGS-65901])

* Before this update, the software catalog in the *Developer* view encountered an issue due to missing `Devfiles` data when a disconnected {product-title} cluster had the `Cluster Samples` Operator removed. As a consequence, users navigating to the *+Add* page encountered an empty software catalog with an error message. With this release, the  `Devfiles` data lookup in the software catalog is disabled, avoiding the error on the *+Add* page and resolving the `Error loading Catalog items` message. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-74158[OCPBUGS-74158])

* Before this update, the upgrade to {product-title} 4.18 caused a loss of network connectivity for virtual machine (VM) pods using `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay` `localnet` network address translations (NAD). As a consequence, VM pod network connectivity was lost during the upgrade. With this release, the fix maintains network connectivity during cluster upgrades to {product-title} 4.18 for VMs using `ovn-k8s-cni-overlay` `localnet` NADs. As a result, the upgrade does not cause a loss of network connectivity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-74268[OCPBUGS-74268])

* Before this update, static pods were terminated prematurely because the kubelet agent did not recognize the `priorityClassName` field. As a consequence, premature termination of static pods led to long shutdown times and storage layer issues in {sno} environments. With this release, static pods acknowledge the `priorityClassName` field for shutdown order in {sno} environments. As a result, static pods follow shutdown order, reducing long shutdown times and storage layer issues. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-74624[OCPBUGS-74624])

* Before this update, {gcp-short} installations failed due to unspecified zones in `install-config` file for regions with AI zones. With this release, the installation program supports AI zones in the `us-south1` and `us-central1` regions, and prevents installation failures. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-74674[OCPBUGS-74674])

* Before this update, the `Jobset-controller-manager` pod lacked the necessary permissions to list pods in the cluster scope, and prevented users from accessing the required pods. With this release, the `Jobset-controller-manager` pod is granted full access to the required resources, resolving the pod readiness issue and improving user experience.
