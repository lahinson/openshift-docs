Understand the known issues that impact your {microshift-short} development and deployments.

* The maximum transmission unit (MTU) value in {microshift-short} OVN-K overlay networking must be 100 bytes smaller than the MTU value of the base network. {microshift-short} automatically configures the value using the MTU value of the default gateway of the host. If the auto-configuration does not work correctly, the MTU value must be configured manually. For more information, see xref:../microshift_networking/microshift-cni.adoc#microshift-network-topology_microshift-about-ovn-k-plugin[Network topology].
