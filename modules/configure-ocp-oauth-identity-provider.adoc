= Configuring {ocp} OAuth server as an identity provider in {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
To integrate the built-in {ocp} OAuth server as an identity provider for {product-title} ({product-title-short}) use the instructions in this section.

.Prerequisites
* You must have the `AuthProvider` permission to configure identity providers in {product-title-short}.
* You must have already configured users and groups in {ocp} OAuth server through an identity provider. For information on the identity provider requirements, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html[Understanding identity provider configuration].

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Access Control*.
. Open the *Add an Auth Provider* menu and select *OpenShift Auth*.
. Enter a name for the authentication provider in the *Name* field.
. Choose a *Minimum access role* for users accessing {product-title-short} by using the selected identity provider.
+
[TIP]
====
For security, Red Hat recommends setting the *Minimum access role* to *None* while you complete setup. Later, you can return to the *Access Control* page to set up more tailored access rules based on user metadata from your identity provider.
====

. To add access rules for users and groups accessing {product-title-short}, use the *Rules* section. For example:
.. To give the *Admin* role to a user called `administrator`, you can use the following key-value pairs to create access rules:
+
|===
| *Key* | *Value*
|Name
|administrator
|Role
|Admin
|===
.. If you are using the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/authentication/understanding-identity-provider.html[HTPasswd Identity Provider] with the username `UserA` that is part of the group `GroupA`, you can use the following key-value pairs to create access rules:
+
|===
| *Key* | *Value*
|Name
|UserA
|Group
|GroupA
|UserID
|<UUID>
|===
. Click *Save*.
