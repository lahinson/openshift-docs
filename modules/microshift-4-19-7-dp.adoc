== Bug fixes

* Before this update, a bare-metal node reboot caused the deployment progress deadline to be surpassed. This resulted in the greenboot health check failing with a false-positive error. With this release, the full timeout duration is provided for the deployment to become ready, reducing false-positive greenboot health check errors. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59301[OCPBUGS-59301])

* Before this update, the excessive polling frequency for the cloud pull secret in node telemetry caused telemetry failure messages to flood journald logs. The log flooding negatively impacted system performance. With this release, the telemetry collection interval is updated from 1 second to 30 seconds. As a result, log flooding has been minimized and no longer impacts system performance. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-59240[OCPBUGS-59240])
